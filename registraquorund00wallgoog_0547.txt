01 25 tuly 1822, the Hense of Commons presented an address 10 the
Crown, steting that the editions of the works of our ancient historiens were
inconvenient and defective3 that many 01 their writings still remained in
manuscript, and, in some cases, in a single copy only. They added, ‘⁴ that an
“ 11110111 and convenient edition of the whole, published underHis Majesty’s
“ royal sanction, would be an undertaking honourable 10 Η10 Majesty’s reign,
“ and conducire to the edvancement 01 historical and constitutional know·
‘⁸ ledgc; that the House therefore humbly besought His Majesty, that He
“ would be graciously pleascd to give such directions 00 Η10 Maiesty, in His
‘⁸ wisdom, might think fit, for the publicationes acomplete edition 011110
‘⁴ ancient historiens 01 this malm, and 00011011 His Majesty that whatever
“ expense might be necessary for this purpose would be made good.”

'lhe Master of the Rolls, being very desimus that effect should be given
10 the resolution of 111οΗ0100 of commone, submitted to Her MsJ'esty's
'l'reasmy in 1857 a plau 101 the publication of the ancient chronicles and
memoriale of the United Kingdom, and it was adopted accordingly. In
selecting these werke, it was considered right, in the first instance, to
give preference to those of which the manuscripts were unique, or the
materiale 01 which would help to fill up blanks in English history for

which no satisfactory and authentis information hitherto existed in any .

accessible form. 010 great object the Master of the Rolls had in view was
to form a corpas historicam within reasonable limite, and which should be
as complete as possible. In a subject 01 so vast a range, it was important
11101 the historical student should be able to select such volumes ss conformed

with his own peculiar testes and studies, and not be put to the expense of
purchasing the whole collection; an inconvenience inseparablc bum any
other plan than that which has been in this instance adopted.

01 the Chronicles and Memorials. the following volumes have been pub·

lished. They embrace the period from the earliest 11110 01 British history
down to tbe end 01 the reign 01 Henry VII.

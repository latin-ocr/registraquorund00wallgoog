ΤΗΒ DIREGTION carna MASThlt Ui* THE ltOLbS,
ΟΝ the aoth oi J anuary 1857, the Master of the Rolls “
submittcd to the Treasmy a proposal for the publication

of materials ior the History oi this Oountry from the
Inwasion oi the Romans to the reign of Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer-
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materIals
as were most scarce and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical docu-
ment tc bo odited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps ; and
for this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally usefnl, the Master
of the Itolls suggested that the editor should give au
account oi the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities; that he should add to the work a
brief account oi the liis and times oi the author, and
any remarks necessary tc explain the chronology3 but
uo other note or comment was to be allowed, except
what might bc necessary to establish the correctness oi

the text.

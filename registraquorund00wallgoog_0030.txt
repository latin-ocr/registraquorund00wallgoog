xx INTRODUOI'ION.

brought more at length under notice in the Introduction
to the succceding Volume.

On placing this Volume before the reader, thc Editor

fcels it his duty to avail himself of the opportunity
of remarking, that an Mpression seems to exist that the
Editors ol the works forming this Series are at liberty to
treat the text, or, to use somcwhat slipshod English,
“alter the manuscript,’' according to the dictatas ol
their own fancy; and ro, toincur censure or the converse,
according to the teste of those who may consider them·
selves qualified to express an opinion upon the results of
their labours.

Such is certainly not the fact3 sor the Editor who
looks upon it aa a duty to ohserve the injunctions
given by the Commission under which he acts, no such
option exista. In the year 1861, a· printed paper,
entitled - “ General Directicns for the Guidance of
‘¹ the Editors‚” was issued to the Editors of the Series.
These mles, in reference to the formation of the text,
are not repealed or obsolete, that the Editor of the
present Volume is aware of; and by them he has
deemed it his duty, to the best of his ability, to abide.
The following are the directions which relate, more
especially, to this point. They are quoted sclcly for the
purpose 'of obviating misapprehension, and not with
the object of sceming even to dictate to others :-

“ Each Editor is to give the various readings of the
‘⁴ MSS. at the foot of the page, without any comment
“ other than is necessary for estahhshing the correctness
‘¹ of his text, or determining chronological difficulties '

“ Classical proper names and all Latin words are to be
“ spelt in the ordinary classical manner, but modern
“names as they occur in the MS, however various.
“When any obvious clerical erroris amended in the
“ text, the erroneous reading of the MS. must be recorded
“ in a note.

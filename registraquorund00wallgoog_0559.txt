The exact date at which this work was written is, according tc the chroniclcr,
1250. The history is 01 considerable valae as an illustration 01 the period during
which the author lived, and contains a good summary citha esents which followed
the conquest. This minor chronicle is, however, based on another work (also
written by Matthew Paris) giving fuller details, which bas been called the
“Historia Major.” The chroniele here published, nevertbeless, gives some

The “Book 01 Hyde ¹’ is a compilation from much earlier sources, which are
usually indicated with considerable care and precision. ln many cases, however,
the Hyde chronicler appears to correct, to quality, or to ampliiy-eithcr from
tradition or from sources 01 information not now discoverable-the statements
which, in substance, 10 adopts. He also mentions, and frequently quotes from,
writers whose vorks are either entirely lost or at present known only by fragments.

There is to be found, in the “Book 01 Hyde,'’ much information relatingto 110
reign 01 King ,4111011 which is not known to exist elsewhere. The volume
contains some carious specimens 01 Anglo-Saxon and lledisrral English.

Itis probable that Pierre de Langtoit was a canon 01 Bridlington, in Yorkshire,
and that he lived in the reign 01 Edward 1.. and duringuportaon 01 the reign 01
Edward 11. This chronicis is dirided into three parlin in the first is an
abridgment 01 Geoffrey 01 Moumonth's “Historia Britonnm,'' in the second, 'a
history 01 the Anglo-Saxon and Norman kings, down 10 the death 01 Henry 111„
andin the third a history 01 the reign 01 Edward I. The priucipal object 01 the
work was apparently 10 show the justice 01 lidward’s Scottish vars. The

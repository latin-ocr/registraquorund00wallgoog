Vetustum ruinosam Domum Capitularem ex lapidi-
bus ,politis renovare disposuit, idealeque propositum suae
mentis sic exteriorem ducere curavit in actum, ut
leve satis foret suo successori, si vellet, opus perfecta

Albani, in honorem Sancti Andreae Apostoli, videmus
Ι solemniter fore consecratam.

Quam gratiosus autem pater iste, et omni pietate
plenus, in progressu fuerit regiminis sui pastoralis,

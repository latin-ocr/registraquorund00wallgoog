“All words are to be printed ia artenao, according to
“ the classicol mode ; but wherever a doubt is occasioned
“ by the abbreviation of the Ms, the Editor may con-
“ sult his own judgment in giving tbe exact form of
‘¹ it among the various readings.

“ Whenever it is desirable that peculiarities of Latin
“ orthography shall be preserved, the peeuliar reading is
‘⁴ to be placed in a scot-note, and notin the text.

“ The MS. orthography of all old English and French
‘⁴ is to be strictly preserved, and abbreviated words
“ written in full.

In conformity with these directions, throughout tbe
present Volume, asin the preceding Volumes of the Series
which have been published under his supervision‚ the
Editor has made it his care to place the Latin text before
the reader as written in the ordinary 1classical manner ;
while the peculiarities of the mediaeval orthograpby have
been preserved in the footnotes: through their agenoy,
in fact, the text may be read under its mediaeval aspect.
And further, conforming with the spirit of the directions
above cited, the Editor has deemed it to be consistent
with his duty throughout ιο be scrupulously sparing of
notes and commenta, whether explanatory or otherwise.

As to the rules and directions themselves, as a guid-
anoe for forming the text, the Editor will only add, that
ithae been no burden to him to observe them3 they are
the best that, under the circumstances, could have been

framed for the production of a text intelligible ιο
ordinary classieal readers, and they stand in need of no
justification or defenoe.

Itis with much pleasure that the Editor expresses his
great obligations to Sir Albert W. Woods‚ ΕΒΑ, Garter

¹Tbe only general exception that dioevrd form which merus ιο have
has been made ιο this rute is in been intended to do duty alike sor

reference to the word “ tiir,’' a me· “ iis ¹' aud ‘⁴ Μεθ’

the moneys of the late Abbot, to satisfy the cravings of

an innata cupidity, which had characterized him even
from childhood. His nefariousness and subtlety are
enlargedupon,¹hispomposity’andverboseness arederided,
his overheard 2lamentatione are sneered at, his sels-
communings and most secret thoughts„ which must have
been known to no one but himself, are professedly brought
to light. J udas and Gehazi, Simon Magus and Ananias,
are set forth as his prototypes, and he is accused in a
spirit of covetousness‚ which might have animated the
veriest usurar, of sacrificing even unto devils. And not
content even with thia, the writer extends the nefarious
charge of stealing the late Abbot’s savings, and of com-
mitting perjury to conceal the theft, to the Archdeaoon's
brother, 8Thomas Walingfordc, who was Abbot Whetham-
stedc's senior Ohaplain, as well. 4In one place, the
Abbot is represented as finally forgiving the Archdeacon,
upon his repentance, and in ⁵another is spoken of aa
being eareful of the Official's honour, and desirous to
preserve it “ without the stain of disgrace‚ or the slightest
Gratim. “ cloud of scandal.'' Even bad not these assuranccs of
{fflssffi the Abbot's considerateness occurred in the narration, it
hmsteue is impossible to believe thatWhetbamstede, whatever his
Je‘fflm peculiarities, and however great his anger against a
ιιιιι defaulting official, would either have committed to
&5⁵ss8 writing such frightful charges as these against a man
person whom he continued in office as his own Archdeacon or
ssffleffi have sanctioned their being committed to writing by
omem others. In the cause of truth and honour, good feeling
gffl and good saith, we have no option lea but to believe
that this narrative, whatever the foundation on which
it may have been based, so far from being written by the

Abbot, never even camo before his eyes.

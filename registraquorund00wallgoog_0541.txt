[Inerant 8ro., eloth. Prior 150. each Volume or Part]

As far back as the year leona Committes 01 11ιο House 01 Commoris
recommended that Indexes and Calendars should be maleto the Public
Records, and thirty-six years afterwards another Committec of the House 01
Commons reiterated that recommendation in more forcible words; but it
was not until the incorporation of the State Paper Office with the Public
Record Office that the present Master of the Rolls found himself in a position
to take the necessary steps for carrying out the wishes of the House 01
Commons.

On 7 December 1855, he stated to the Lords of the Treasury that although
‘⁸ the Records‚ State Papers, aud Documenta in his charge constitute the most
“ complete and perfect series of their kind in the civiliaed world,” and
although “they are of the greatest 10100 in a historical and constitutions!
“ point 01 view, yet they are comparatirely useless 10 the public, from the
“ want of proper Calendars and Indexes.”

Acting upon the recommendatione 01 the Committees 01 the Hense of
Commons above referred to, he suggested to the Lords of the Tmasury that
10 effect the obJ'ect he had in view it would be necessary for him to employ a
few persons fully qualified to perform the work which he contemplated.

Their Iaordships asserted 10 the necessity of having Calendars prepared
and printed, and empowered the Master of the Rolls 10 take such steps as
might be necessary for this purpose.
